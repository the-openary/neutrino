The CAD model uses the following models as placeholders for now:

- [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-zero-1)
- [BLTouch](https://grabcad.com/library/bltouch-v3-1-1)
- [Lolin D1 Mini](https://grabcad.com/library/wemos-esp8266-lolin-d1-mini-v4-1)
- As well as an SKR Mini & E3D v6 from the VORON Project 3D printer CAD files

These models were very useful during the design process off the printer, particularly when mapping out locations of the different parts. These will be replaced by custom-made models in the future, but for now these models are used
