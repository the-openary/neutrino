# PrusaSlicer Settings

Config files for PrusaSlicer. Currently contains the printer settings and profiles for:

Layer heights:
- 0.3mm
- 0.2mm

Filaments:
- PLA

More to be added soon. Currently one large file, working on separating each profile so you can import only what you need. Refer to [PrusaSlicer Documentation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-import-and-export-custom-profiles-in-prusaslicer_382766) for help.
