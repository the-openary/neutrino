The `dev_process` folder contains a selection of notes & data that provide a peek into the development process of this printer. Due to privacy reasons it is only a snippet. If there's something specific feel free to reach out. 

### Features

### FAQ:

**Why a Bowden Setup?**

Initially the printer had a Direct Drive setup, but this was later swapped to Bowden. There were a couple reasons for this
- Faster printing
- Short tube length
- Easier maintenance
- Easier to explain to others
    - Being a portable printer, many people who have never seen a 3D printer see it. I think this makes Neutrino double as an educational/inspirational tool and for that reason it is easier to explain the separate parts of a Bowden extruder vs a DD setup. 

**Where can I source my parts?**

Anywhere you can find them. It uses all standard 8mm + M3 hardware. AliExpress, Amazon, spare parts, etc. Unfortunately you will need to print your own parts for now, but that will change soon.

**Is there an assembly guide?**

Not yet, working on that soon. For now you should just use the CAD. There is also the [discord](https://discord.gg/VZFWGp7FHZ) for help. I can assist you personally there.
